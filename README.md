This project aims to forecast gold prices in Egypt by analyzing their relationship with the USD and global market prices using traditional ML models and time series forecasting.

## üìå Introduction

Gold holds great significance in Egypt, both culturally and economically. From ancient times to the modern era, gold has symbolized wealth, heritage, and financial security. As Egypt's economy evolved, the local gold market started reflecting global economic trends and USD fluctuations. This project investigates these relationships to predict gold prices effectively.

## üéØ Project Goal

- Analyze the correlation between gold prices in Egypt and the US dollar
- Forecast gold prices using:
  - ARIMA (time-series model)
  - ML models: SVR, XGBoost, Bayesian Ridge, Gradient Boosting, Decision Tree, Random Forest
  - (Upcoming) Deep learning: LSTM & RNN
- Predict prices for various gold karats (24K, 22K, 21K, 18K, 14K, 12K)
